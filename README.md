HoopOdds is a Discord bot built to deliver NBA data and game predictions directly to your server. From recent game scores and detailed player stats to predicting game outcomes, HoopOdds is your all-in-one basketball companion. Powered by a machine learning model trained on historical NBA data, the bot provides accurate insights for basketball fans and enthusiasts.

### Key Features

- Fetch recent NBA game scores.
- Provide detailed player statistics.
- List all NBA teams.
- Predict game outcomes using historical data and machine learning.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Discord.py**: Framework for bot development.
- **scikit-learn**: Used logistic regression for game outcome predictions.
- **Pandas**: Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **balldontlie API**: NBA data source.

## Features

- **Fetch Scores**: Use `!scores` or `!games` to get the latest NBA game results.

- **Player Details**: Use `!players <name>` to retrieve information about a player.

- **Team Listings**: Use `!teams` to list all NBA teams.

- **Game Predictions**: Use `!predict <team1> <team2>` to predict the outcome of a matchup.

- **Future Capabilities**: In the future, the bot will be able to fetch current injuries, player stats, and other real-time data for enhanced predictions.

## Commands

1. **`!scores`**\*\* or \*\*\*\*`!games`\*\*:
   Fetch recent NBA game scores.

   ```plaintext

   - Incorporate player stats, injuries, or roster changes.
   - Consider home-court advantage and team standings.

2. **Model Refinement**:

   - Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
   - Use hyperparameter tuning to boost accuracy.

3. **Dynamic Predictions**:

   - Include live stats before generating predictions.
   - Adjust predictions based on real-time factors such as injuries.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:

   - Implement precision/recall and confusion matrix for better performance tracking.
